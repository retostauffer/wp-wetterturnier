<h1>Wetterturnier Group Member Management</h1>

<help>
   While you are able to change the <b>group</b> settings in the <b>group</b>
   menu entry, you can change the members/users in a group in here. 
   It allows you to add users to a group (set them as active group members),
   or remove them from a group (will set them inactive). As long as a user
   is active in a group, his/her bet will be included while computing the
   mean group bet for a certain tournament.
   Note that you - as an administrator - are able to add random people to
   random groups. However, there is a small application form where users can
   endorse themselves to get a new member of an existing group. An admin has
   to approve/reject these endorsements (see <b>group application</b>).
</help>

<help>
   <b>Users count as active group members</b> when they have been <b>activated
   on the day of the tournament</b> or have <b>not been deactivated before the
   end of the day of the tournament</b>.
   <br>
   <b>An example:</b> let's assume that there was a tournament on the
   24th of June 2017 (2017-06-23). If you <b>add a user</b> to a group
   till "2017-06-23 23:59:59" it will be included in the tournament (even
   if the tournament starts at 16 UTC!.
   Users which have been members at 00 UTC of the day of the tournament
   <b>will be included as well</b>. If you <b>disable a user</b> in a certain group
   on the day of the tournament (later or equal to "2017-06-23 00:00:00") it 
   <b>will be included in the mean bet</b>.

   In SQL this is (see python backend code, database.get_bet_data() function):<br>
   [...] AND gu.since <= '2017-06-24 00:00:00' AND (gu.until IS NULL OR gu.until >= '2017-06-23 00:00:00')
